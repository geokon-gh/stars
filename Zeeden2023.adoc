= Earth's rotation and Earth-Moon distance in the Devonia derived from multiple geological records

Summarized by George Kontsevich

== Problem: Moon is floating away too fast

. The tides exert a braking force on the earth
. The force causes the moon the moon to move away from the Earth at 3.83 cm/year
- Working back, the Earth would "hit" the moon at ~1.5 Ga
. The moon is ~4.4 Ga
Therefore the tidal braking force must have changed over time

== Possible Cause: Continental Drift

As the distribution of the continents has changed over time, the global tide system has changes in conjunction - and hence the braking power of the tides

As the continents move there are changes in:

. Average depth
. Dissipation factor

In _Farhat et al. 2022_ they manage to make a simulation of the past changes in continent drift that explains the changes in the Moon recession rate

A parameter of the Earth/Moon vs. Sun system therefore:

. Not affected by changes in distance to the Moon
. Not affected by changes on Earth
. Relatively constant/predictable function of the other celestial bodies

== Strategy

1. Find samples with constant sedementation rate and measure some parameter (eg. magnetic suseptability)
2. Estimate a sedementation rate .. vaguely
3. Find an eccentricity signal near what would make sense for 400kyr/100kyr
4. Adjust the sedimentation rate to make it match the eccentricity
5. Find other peaks that correspond to _obliquity_ and _precession_

Repeat this over many samples and average your results to get an estimate of the precession rate
