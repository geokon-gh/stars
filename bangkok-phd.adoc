== Directions in Speleothem research


_The Asian monsoon over the past 640,000 years and ice age terminations_ *Hai Cheng et al.* Nature (2016)

.Speleothem reconstruction of the monsoon had been effective "completed" in 2016
* Synthetic record from multiple speleothems
* Very high temporal resolution
* Accurate in both time and amount (^18^O)
* Spans the full time span available with U-Th dating (~600kyr)

.Outstanding questions..
1. How does this look in different locations around Asia (BORING/DIFFICULT)?
2. When speleothem *^18^O* changes, how exactly is the monsoon changing?
3. Are there other drivers of *^18^O* we can look at?
4. Are there other proxies other than *^18^O* we could be looking at? (For later..)

== Two Monsoons on a local scale

We could also try to focus in on a very local region

PRO: Close proximity reduces the influence of secondary drivers of precipitation

CON: The &Delta;^18^O between closely spaced caves maybe be too small to detect

== Characterizing the speleothem growth

.Simple model...
an increase/decrease in the monsoon is either:
--

1. rain season length decreased/increased
2. daily rainfall totals decreased/increased

=== Two Speleothems

.Objective:
Locate a cave with two speleothems have different "responses" to rainfall.
