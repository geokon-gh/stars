The text is layed out several sections:
- Climate Archives
- Orbital Climate Change
- Paleoclimate History

* Code Configuration :noexport:
All plots are generated in Clojure in the original org-mode file (which is then exported to HTML). see [[https://geokon-gh.github.io/literate-clojure.html][literate-clojure.html]] for how this is done

All plots are made directly from the original data (as downloaded from their respective sources) unless indicated otherwise.

See the original org-mode file for data is read in and how figures are generated

* /*Climate Archives*/
* CO_{2}
CO_{2} is an important paleo archive both because past CO_{2} can be relatively easily infered from several sources and because the CO_{2} cycle seems to be a closely linked to many paleoclimate phenomena

** Comparative: Venus
Venus:
- Gets about 2 times the flux of light as Earth *albedo*
- Reflects 80% of the light that hits it (vs. Earth's 26%)
- Atmosphere is 90 times as dense and 90% CO2
- Visible and other light is absorbed and reradiated (due to blackbody radiation) in a longer wavelength which is adbsorbed by C02
** The CO_{2} Cycle
*** Carbon Resevoirs
in gigatons..
- Vegetation: 610
- Soils 1560
- Atmosphere: 600 (preindustrial)
- Ocean mixing layer : 1000
- Deep Ocean 38 000
- Sediment and rocks: 66 000 000

Volcanism only releases (and incoporate from the deep sea) about 0.2 gigatons per year - but on a geological time frame this is sufficient to drive the system. If all volcanism stopped then in about 4000 years most carbon to leave the atmosphere and 24700 years for all surface carbon to be gone (soil/vegetation/surface oceans) and 278000 if including the deep oceans

*** CO2 Removal

CO2 is released from the sediment by volcanism and returns to the sediment through chemical weathering of continental rocks

- Hydrolysis :: water + rocks + CO2 (80% of carbon return to the sediment)
The rocks on the continental shelves are mostly silicate minerals (ex: quartz feldspar) which are typically made of positively charges cations: Na+1 K+1 Fe+2 Mg+2 Al+3 and Ca+2 bonded to negatively charges silicate SiO4. Silicate minerals are dissolved by carbonic acid H2CO3 which is formed by CO2 and rainwater and form clay minerals as well as dissolved ions that are incorporated in the shells of planktic organisms

ex: 
H2O + CO2 -> H2CO3 (carbonic acid)
H2CO3 + CaSiO3 (silicate rock) -> CaCO3 (shells of organisms) + SiO2 + H2O

However shelled organisms only appeared 540 Myr ago. Before that this must have happened in shallow seas where chemical precipitation occured due to high concentrations of CaCO3 (non biologically)

Photosynthesizing planktonic plants appear in the last 250Myr (ex: Coccolithophorida)

- Dissolution :: dissolving limestone

Is an intermediary process that dissolved CO2 into the water that runs in the oceans but in the end it re-releases the cardbon dioxide back to the atmosphere

H2O + CO2 -> H2CO3 (carbonic acid)
H2CO3 + CaCO3 (limestone) -> CaCO3 (shells of organisms) + H2O + CO2

*** The Thermostat

As temperatures rise the rate of weather of the continental shelf increases which results in a faster absorption of CO2 by the sediment.
Chemical weathering doubles for every 10 degree increase in temperature. Also hotter temperatures lead to higher precipitation which also leads to more weathering

Plants in effect move C02 from the atmosphere into the soil which make the CO2 more ready to form carbonic acid H2CO3 and do weathering.

In an early Earth there is also no oxygen really. So methane and ammonia would not break down as quickly

Water is also a major greenhouse gas - higher temperatures lead to more water in the air. So it acts as a positive feedback loop! As opposed to CO2 which is a negative feedback loop

However if all the continents are near the equator then you could have a ton of weathering, low CO2 levels and then develop a snowball earth

CO2 seems to have a strong temperature effect as long as there is ice to melt (b/c it acts as a positive feedback mechanism that amplifies the effect)

CO2 also can get staturated in the atmosphere and starts to have less additional effect in trapping heat
** CO_{2} linked phenomena
*** Faint Young Sun Paradox
Closer to the Earth's formation (~4.55Byrs ago) the sun was 25-30% less than today and yet according to climate records the Earth was not frozen over entirely

One theory is that this was due to volcanism that happened to exactly offset the cooler climate. There is no feedback mechanism for volcanism, so this would hve to have been coincidental...

*** Glaciation
all from [fn:BOOK-Ruddiman]

As glaciers retreat there is more CO_{2} is present in the atmosphere. The change is about ~90 ppm change - or about a third of all atomospheric carbon. The change is substantial.. why?

During glacial times there is less room for vegitation (as there are huge ice sheets covering continents), so the mass of carbon in terrestrial plans should decrease. So the carbon can't be in more plant matter.

Note that the surface of the ocean is an equilibrium with atmospheric CO_{2}. So if the average atmospheric CO_{2} dropped, then dissolved ocean surface CO_{2} must have also dropped an equivalent amount. So if you want to calculate the total amount of carbon that's dissappeared during glaciation you must count both the one in the atmosphere and the one in the surface ocean (as well as the missing land plants)

It must then be getting store in the deep ocean somehow

** Potential CO_{2} regulation mechanisms
*** BLAG Hypothesis
- Sea floor spreading and volcanism release CO2
- CO2 is then incorporated into shells and subducted
- subducted CO2 either scraps off onto the continental shelf or goes deep and comes back up as silicate rock

Weathering: 
CaSiO3 + CO2 -> CaCO3 + SiO2 
silicate rock -> plankton + plankton

Subduction:
CaCO3 + SiO2 -> CaSiO3 + CO2
ocean sediment -> silicate rock + CO2

So random changes in volcanism result in changes in climate

*** Uplift Weathering Hypothesis
- Uplifted material then breaks into lil pieces at plateau margins and then creates massive surface areas and leads to huge CO2 removal. Known as *mass wasting*
- Steep slopes are also where it rains a lot.
- After material is broken into lil pieces (like due to a scrapping glacier) it very quickly weathers a ton and then stops weathering nearly as much

- A lot of these things happen when continents collide - which isn't veyr often - but coincides with glaciation (presumably b/c you take out a massive amount of CO2 and decrease teh greenhouse effect and cause freezing)

*** Data
CO_{2} Data used in Hai Cheng's work was the one from GISP2. In his "final" paper with the full 640,000 year stalagmite record [fn:Cheng2016] he uses revised data from EPICA Dome C [fn:Bereiter2014]. The data is available online here:
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/17975

I think the last data file is what is needed =Text Data File    Antarctic Ice Core Revised Composite CO2 Data=. This contains a column for the /age/ (in years), /CO_{2}/ (in ppm) and the /\sigma_{CO_{2}}/

** CO_{2} Records
*** Foraminifera isotope signatures
all from [fn:BOOK-Ruddiman]

\shy{}^{12}C is preferrentially taken up by plants of photosynthesis and \shy{}^{13}C is preferrentially left in inorganic carbon (ex: CO_{2} and dissolved ions in water). So there is about a 25\permil{} difference between the two. As the glaciers retreat there is more room for plants, they grow in mass and take up \shy{}^{12}C leaving the oceans more \shy{}^{13}C rich. And then during glaciation this \shy{}^{12}C gets flushed into the oceans.

We can then look at the total mass movement
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
carbon in ocean during interglacial + carbon on land =  carbon in oceans during glacial times
#+END_QUOTE
And we can estimate, if all the carbon went to the deep ocean during interglacial and comes out during glacial, how much should the isotopes shift.

We can then look at \shy{}^{13}C in benthic foraminferal shells which are formed out of dissolved CaCO_{3} (calcium carbonate) and see if it corresponds to what we estimate the value for the istope ratio of the oceans should be. (*Note:* Why don't we just look at CO_{2} in the ice cores? I don't know..)

How does CO_{2} get stores in the deep ocean..?

- high temp = less soluable CO_{2} :: counter to what we see.. we see MORE CO_{2} in the air during cold glacial times
- less salty water = more soluable CO_{2} :: glacial times are saltier times, and though could increase CO_{2} levels by about 11ppm
- photoplankton = takes out mostly  \shy{}^{12}C and sinks to the bottom :: This leaves sufrace waters more and more  \shy{}^{13}C rich if there is a lot of productivity. The raining \shy{}^{12}C will by contrast make the benthic environment very \shy{}^{12}C rich. The higher this contrast/gradient between benthic and planktonic foraminifera the more ocean productivity you can infer. (*Note*: Deep water changes take hundreds of years - inducing a huge lag)

So a likely hypoethesis is that there is a huge increase in ocean productivity during glacial times - though it's not clear why (ex: iron fertilization due to glacial winds). A more general reason could be a shift in ocean circulation.

Conversely \shy{}^{16}O is preferrentially evaporated and precipitated out onto large glacial ice sheets leaving the ocean \shy{}^{18}O rich. So the two isotope signatures should co-vary. 


*** Glacial Ice
- kilometers thick in Antarctica
- ~700,000 years (Antarctica)
- ~120,000 years (Greenland)
This is typically extracted from the top of an ice dome. Snow/ice piles up and flows down the slopes. But the ice from the very top of the dome just moves downwards and outwards - pancaking into thinner and thinner layers as it moves down. After a certain distance down the snow is compacted into ice and the air caught in the matrix is no longer free to exchange with the atmosphere. About 50m down the air becomes trapped in bubbles (as a result the ice can be much older than the air it captures). This air has a record of both the CO_{2} and CH_{4} concentrations. Ages is determined by either counting the annual layers (when there is a decent amount of annual snowfall), or my modeling the iceflow and estimating the age of different depths. Counting layers at very distant ages becomes very difficult as the layers are hard to distinguish.

The data from Ruddiman is actually found here: 
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/2476

Files are read in as-is. The format is a bit clunky to parse and the age goes back as far as 400 000 years

Another dataset that have d18O and CO2 is here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/2438 But again, hard to parse

However the following seem to have methane data from several locations https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/2438

Unfortunatly this only goes back  12000 years

As explained in the data file - this is a composite

* CH_{4}
all from [fn:BOOK-Ruddiman]

Methane is produces in anoxic conditions - mostly originating in wetlands where rotting organic matter quickly consumes all the available oxygen

Methane records in Antarctica seem to follow low-latitude insolation (reminder: insolation changes differ by latitude)  and are theorized to correspond to changes in the monsoon (which also follows low-latitude insolation). Correspondance is not just in phase, but also in amplitude. *TODO* SHOW THIS

The regularity of the methane changes and how they closely follow the monsoon means they can be used as a chronometer when looking at ice records [fn:Ruddiman2003]


** CH_{4} Records
*** Lake records?
Can methane be measured from the lake/bog sediment instead of the atmospheric record?
*** Glacial Ice

* Sea Level
- transgression :: when the sea level is so high the ocean covers the continental shelf (vs *regression*)
- floods the continental shelf and you start building sediment on the continental shelf
- Since the sediment can be uplifted or the continent may rise/lower due to isostatic rebound
- The weight of the sediment had made underlying rock subside. The water that was above it also added weight at the time of formation

May be due to changes in the volume of Ocean Basins. As ocean floor gets old it starts to sink and make a deep basin. So young fast spreading see floor will be less deep and lead to higher sea levels

Fast Spreading: wide ocean ridges \\
Slow Spreading : narrow ocean ridges with deep basins

Ridge Depth = 2500m + 350 * sqrt(crust-age)

Therefore if you have fast spreading globally then ocean basins are globally smaller and then you get sea level rise!
** Glaciers
Sea level is ties to the amount of glaciation there is currently going on

Glaciation *accumulation* and *ablation* both have different rates and have very different responses to changes in temperature/insolation. Generaly the ice will accumulate quite slowly and substantial changes in ice mass can take many years. It's also not very important if it's -5C or -10C - as long as it's cold enough (in fact you will get less growth is it's too cold and the air is dry). Meanwhile ablation can be pretty rapid and increases rapidly as it gets warmer.

Once a glacier has grown it can reach several kilometers high - and at this higher altitude it harder for it to start melting. So once a glacier is established it has staying power. It can continue to withstand a hotter climate up to a point. So relatively speaking, if there is no glacier you need to get to a much lower termpature threshhold to start glacier growth than if you have a glacier already there.

Now the glacier needs to be mostly viewed in aggrigate over it's whole mass b/c the ice moves and different parts of the icesheet will be at different altitudes. If the high altitiude accumulation offsets the low altitude ablation then you have a state of stable equilibrium. The total mass of the icesheet will remain the same (and hence sea levels won't change)

The controlling factor is summer insolation. In the winter it's generally cold enough at high altitude to accumulate ice no matter the insolation - hence winter insolation is not so important. Winter insolation will just change things at lower altitudes a bit - and the winter getting even colder won't change how much ice/snow grows on the top. But change in summer insolation can greatly accelerate the ablation (which again, is very temperature sensitive) which can lead to a quick change in ice mass. If the ice mass decreases, then the altitude of the top decreases and you can end up with a run away positive feedback (though this seems like it'd only happen if the altitude drops below some threshold?)

Simulataneously you have the underlying bedrock which slowly slumps and rebounds under the growing/shrinking glaciers which also creates a "response". Glacier seems to have grown and shrunk due to insolation - first at a 44kyr rate and then at a 100kyr rate. My guess is the change was due to a change in the thresholding mechanism. The response of the glacier to changes in insolation is observed to have a significant delay. 

*** Glacier Records: Benthic Foraminifera d18O
Both sensitive to the water's d18O and temperature.

*TODO*: Get the latest composite data .. from somewhere?

** Corals
In some locations Corals are growing over areas that are being actively rapidly uplifted. Some species of coral grow exclusively close to the surface of the ocean. If the uplift rate can be determined then the record of coral growth can tell you the changes in sea level (these are dated through Uranium Thorium dating)

*** Coral Sea level record:
*TODO* Find latest record :)

* Sediment
** Ocean floor 
- ~170MY then destroyed by tectonics
- Waves disturb sediment several meters down (storms ~10s of meters)
- Earthquakes/Tsunamis disturb slopes
- Depends a lot on locations (river delta vs. deep ocean)
- Change in sea levels can make areas have sediment intermitendly
- While it may rain a lot of silica and calcium carbonate shells - if the ocean pressure is high and the temperature is low then these can dissolve back into the ocean
- The shells themselves can change the chemical compostion of the ocean (Diatomes)
- Ocean floor is about 5-10km thick (3.2g/cm^3) vs 30-70km for the continent (2.7g/cm^3). Both "floats" on top of the 3.6 g/cm^3 mantle (2890km - half way to center)
** Coast

Changes in these produce *burial fluxes* and can tell you about the climate

- down rivers junk *fluvial sediments*
- brought on the wind *eolian sediments*
- brought out into the ocean by icebergs *ice-rafted debris* (big peaks = Heinrich events)

sediment grains can sometimes be traces back to their origin with chemical analysis

The grains can either be generated by
- *chemical weathering* : either through
+ /dissolving/ into water 
+  /hydrolysis/ where water is added chemically 
ex: CO2 + H2O -> H2CO3 which is an acid that breaks down rocks and makes chemical ions drift off into the rivers
these are then picked up by plankton and incorporated into their shells
So by looking at the chemistry of foraminifera you can know the changes in chemistry on land

** Moraines
- Lakes left by retreating glaciers
- Get repeatedly erased each time the glacier advances
** Loess
- Dust settles in areas of low winds
- ~3MY
* Fossils
- give a time frame for the rock they're in
- Diatomes :: formed of silicate (which dissolves in corrosive oceans). Their appearance changed the chemistry of the oceans - evolved around =185 Ma= /Jurassic/ 
- Coccoliths/Foraminifera :: made of calcium carbonate (form huge layers like the cliffs of Dover at about 0.5mm/year - under huge weight it forms chalk)
- OAE :: Oceanic Anoxic events - think layers of carbon that are presevered world wide due to changes in ocean: *blac shale* or *sapropels*

Using plants that look similar to current living ones

Pollen deposites (unclear.. fossilized?)

* Magnetic Reversals
 flips in the magnetic field are "stored" in ocean floor basalt and in volcano layers
the latest is called the *Brunhes* reversal =0.78Ma=. This process is uneven as seafloor formation is uneven

* /*Orbital Climate Change*/
When it comes to the effects of the Earth's orbital there are two drivers, /obliquity/ and /eccentricity/ and two effect, /change in obliquity/ and /precession of the equinox/. While these processes are cyclical and look sinusoidal they are described using sums of many different sinusoids. The values and equations are described in Berger 1978 [fn:Berger1978]. They seem to be appropriate going back 1M years. Note that there are also newer values in Berger 1991 that go back 10M years [fn:Berger1991]. These tables are also reproduced in his review paper from 2004 [fn:Berger2004]
* Obliquity
This is the tilt of the axis around which the earth spins. When the axis is aligned such that the either the top or bottom of Earth points at the sun, then you get the /summer/winter solstice/. At this point the day's length in the norther or southern hemisphere is at it's longest. Right now this is Jun 21st and December 21st. Between the two points you have two moments when the day and night is of equal length - known as the /equinox/. Obliquity undergoes two changes:
** Amplitude
The obliquity will change in degree from /22.2\deg{}/ to /24.5\deg{}/ on a /41 000 years/ cycle. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#Oscillation][On Wikipedia]] you can find it described in terms of a polynomial, however we will follow the sum of sinusoids example from [fn:Berger1978].

** Precession
The direction of the axis will rotate (relative to the orbital plane and the stars) like a misaligned spinning top in a process known as /axial precession/. The axis currently points at Polaris, but this will slowly change and draw a big circle in the sky (the change has been observed over historical time scales). This can also be described numerically, but as we'll see this is unnecessary

* Eccentricity
The Earth also goes around in the sun in a slight oval, where the major axis is about 3% longer than the minor axis. When the Earth is farthest, on July 4th, it is at its /apehelion/ (158M km) . When it is at its closest, January 3rd, it's at its /perhelion/ (153M km). This similarly undergoes two changes

Note that at the moment, from the March 20th equinox to Sept 22 equinox the Earth passes the /perihelion/ and goes faster (as potential energy is turned to kinetic). Hence from Sep 22 to March 20th it passes the /apehilion/ you get an *extra 7 days* as the Earth is flung out and slows down
** Amplitude
The degree of this eccentricity will vary, from Earth's orbit being almost circular, to being more elliptical. This is described in very similar terms to the changes in /obliquity/

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
e = e_{0} + \sum{} E_{i} cos(\lambda{}_{i}t + \phi{}_{i}) \\
..\\
e_{0} = 0.028707
#+END_QUOTE
We again just grab the first few terms. For a more accurate solution take more terms from the tables in [fn:Berger1978]
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
E_{0} = 0.01102940 \\
\lambda{}_{0} = 3.3138886 \\
\phi{}_{0} = 165.16 \\
\\
E_{1} = -0.00873296 \\
\lambda{}_{1} = 13.650058 \\
\phi{}_{1} = 279.68 \\
\\
E_{2} = -0.00749255 \\
\lambda{}_{2} = 10.511172 \\
\phi{}_{2} = 114.51 \\

But as we can see, the equations don't converge as well/fast as for the obliquity. So the eccentricity spectrum will be more messy

** Precession
The direction of the major/minor axis will also vary over time relative to the stars. On its own it doesn't cause any changes, however it "interferes" with the precession of the obliquity. The combined effect will be described shortly.

** Obliquity Amplitude
As the tilt of the planet increases, the change between winter and summer becomes more severe. The effect applies to both the northern and southern hemispehere equally
* Precession of the Equinox
As the rotational axis changes over time, it will at times align with the eccentricity of the orbit such, for instances, that during summer solstice the planet is closest the Sun while during the winter solstice it is furthest away. Or you can get the inverse situation, where the winter solstice is at the /perihelion/. Both these situations will create a bias towards one hemisphere and either the north or south will get a larger fraction of the Sun's heat. 

To track the degree of alignment between the orbital ellipse and the rotational axis we look at the angle /\omega{}/ between the /perihelion/ and the March 20th /equinox/. 

The difference of heat between /apihelion/ and /perihelion/ is also being modulated by the changes in the amplitude of the eccentricity. If the orbit is at a time where it's near-circular then there is little difference between the warming during /apihelion/ and /perihelion/ and therefore the orientation of the rotational axis relative to the orbit's major axis has little effect. However if the eccentricity is near a maximum then this effect is felt strongly. The combined effect is described with the product ~e sin( \omega{} )~ and can again be described with a sum of sinusoids
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
e sin( \omega{} ) = \sum{} P_{i} sin(\alpha{}_{i}t + \zeta{}_{i}) \\
..\\
e - /eccentricity (defined previously as the sum of sinusoids)/ \\
omega - /the angle btwn the perihelion and the March 20th equinox/ \\
*note*: the sine terms can be replaces with cosines. There is also no constant term b/c precession is symmetric
#+END_QUOTE
This product is also known as the *precession index*. Again the terms in the sum of sinusoids are defined in the tables [fn:Berger1978]

To verify the correct behavior (since we are not plotting /\omega{}/ directly) I've added the change in eccentricity in gray - and you can see how the product makes the /eccentricity/ behave as an envolope for the /precession of the equinox/ - squeezing it down at its minimums.

In red is the a 10 term precession - and it looks even at 3 terms we've already converged to a decent solution. The "envelope" however doesn't match very well b/c as shown before, even 10 terms isn't really sufficient

Using the precession of the equinox you can actually split the year into a half where the northern hemisphere gets more sun and a half where the southern gets more sun. This split creates what are known as the *caloric insolation seasons* and they're not exactly centered on the summer/winter solstice b/c of the perihelion offset.

Note that there are much longer term variations in frequency over tectonic time as well. ~400 Myrs ago the  *Precession* was 20 000 years  and the *Tilt* changed every 30 000 years.

* Daily Insolation 
According to Milankovitch there is an additional complication. Land mass is unevenly distributed around the globe, with the Northern hemisphere having much more land than the Southern hemisphere. Land generally has a much higher albedo than the oceans (ie. it will reflect back more solar radiation) but it also has a lower heat capacity and doesn't mix. So heating up the land leads to a rapid increase in the surface temperature - which at sea much of the heat gets mixed away into the deep (and redistributed around the globe). The net effect of an increase in solar radiation in the northern hemisphere (at the expense of the south) is something like "more temperature variability", however the specifics are a bit difficult to pinpoint. This is canonically observed by calculating the June insolation value at latitude 65\deg{} North.

The calculation for this is complicated by the fact that the position of the start and end of "June" on the orbit around the sun varies as all the orbital parameters change. A more simplified calculation is to pick a "day" in the year. This day has a corresponding position on the orbit indicated by degrees and called the longitude. I think this analogous to the Earth's longitude, except here the "sphere" is the whole orbit of the earth around the sun. Then measuring the insolation at 65 degrees North becomes a geometric problem.

Berger presents a solution for latitudes within the arctic/antarctic circle in the Appendix of his 1978 paper[fn:Berger1978]. However the equation is left with a bunch of intermediary variables that we need to unpack before we can simulate it. He leaves us with this equation:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
W = [86.4 S_{0} / (\pi{}\rho{}^{2})] (H_{0} sin\phi{} sin\delta{} + cos \phi{} cos \delta{} sin H_{0} )
#+END_QUOTE
Taking things piece by piece. First we look at *\delta{}*
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- S_{0} ::  W m^{-2} - some factor (I don't understand where it comes from). If 86.4 then the result /W/ is in kJ m^{2} day^{-1}. If 1.95 then /W/ is in cal cm^{2} day^{-1} 
- \delta{} :: *declination of the sun*. This has a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_of_the_Sun#Declination_of_the_Sun_as_seen_from_Earth][specific meaning]]. "The declination of the Sun, \delta{}, is the angle between the rays of the Sun and the plane of the Earth's equator". So it's not a latitude-dependent declination, but a characteristic of the earth-sun orientation for a specific point in time. Our intuition tells us that the angle of the sun goes up and down during different parts of the year. On a longer time scale it will also vary as the  obliquity /\epsilon{}/ varies.
sin \delta{} = sin \eplison{} sin \lambda{}
- \lambda{} :: *true longitude of the earth* is counted counterclockwise from the vernal equinox
#+END_QUOTE
Next we look at the parameter *H_{0}*
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- H :: *the absolute value of the hour angle of the sun at sunrise and sunset*. The hour-angle is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour_angle][explained on wikipedia]]. The angle at which the sun sets or rises is clearly both a function of which latitude you are on as well as a function of the sun's declination relative to the earth.
cos H_{0} = - tan \phi{} tan \delta{}
#+END_QUOTE
The last thing we need to define is *\rho{}*
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- \rho{} :: *normalized earth-sun distance*. If the true distance is /r/ and the semi-major axis /a/ then a normalized value/ration will be a function of both the eccentricity and where it is on the orbital ellipse
\rho{} = r/a = [ 1-e^{2} ] / [ 1 + e cos v ]
- - v :: true anomaly: position angle of the earth on it's orbit, counted counterclockwise from the /perihelion/. Remember that over the years the date of the /perihelion/ moves throught the year (this our \omega{} which was a function of time). The true anomaly is explained [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_anomaly][one Wikipedia]]
\lambda{} = v + \omega{} /or/ v = \lambda{} - \omega{}
#+END_QUOTE
Combining terms into one equation would give us a very complicated equation. By looking at the summer solstice we can simplify things substantially. In any case, this is generally the time period we are interested in. 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
At the solstice: \\
*\lambda{} = 90\deg{}* \\
\there4{} \\
sin \delta{} = sin \epsilon{} sin \lambda{} = sin \epsilon{} \\
\there4{} \\
*\delta{} = \epsilon* \\
and \\
cos H_{0} = - tan \phi{} tan \delta{} = - tan \phi{} tan \epsilon{} \\
\there4{} \\
*H_{0}* = *cos^{-1} (- tan \phi{} tan \epsilon{})* \\
*sin H_{0}* = *\radic{}[1 - cos H_{0}] = \radic{}[1 + tan \phi{} tan \epsilon{} ]* \\
and \\
v = \pi{}/2 - \omega{} \\
\there4{} \\
*\rho{}* = [ 1-e^{2} ] / [ 1 + e cos (\pi{}/2 - \omega{}) ] = *[ 1-e^{2} ] / [ 1 + e sin \omega{} ]* \\
#+END_QUOTE
Now we can write out the full equation
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
W = [86.4 S_{0} / \pi{}] [( 1 + e sin \omega{} )/( 1-e^{2} )]^{2} (cos^{-1} (- tan \phi{} tan \epsilon{}) sin\phi{} sin\epsilon{} + cos \phi{} cos \epsilon{} \radic{}[1 + tan \phi{} tan \epsilon{} ] 
#+END_QUOTE
*Note*: That in Berger 1993 they manage to drop the /H/ terms by looking at noon insolation. I'm not clear on how that's justified. \\
Now given a latitude \phi{} and a time, we can solve for the insolation. However a direct spectral interpretation is a bit elusive. Looking term by term:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- (1 + e sin \omega{})^{2} :: a precessional factor (~22kyr period). But it's squared and /e sin \omega{}/ is a sum of many different sinusoids. When we multiply sinusoids we get ringing. Remember that /2 cos a sin b = = cos(a-b) + cos(a+b). So these ~22kyr will ring around ~44kyr and look like obliquity
- 1/( 1-e^{2} )^{2} :: an eccentricity term (~410kyr period and ~100kyr period). This will also ring but it's unclear if the magnitude is significant
- (cos^{-1} (- tan \phi{} tan \epsilon{}) sin\phi{} sin\epsilon{} :: all terms except the /\epsilon{}/'s are constants. So this is an /obliquity/ factor. Note that each /\epsilon{}/ is a sum of sinusoids. And you're doing the /sine/ of that. Wrapping a sinusoid in a sinusoid is equivalent to [[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/mdft/FM_Spectra.html][frequency modulation]] with a 0Hz baseband. So you should have +/- the frequencies of /\epsilon{}/ and then smaller terms at whole multiples of that frequency. The cos^{-1} term is harder to understand.is This grows as the latitude /\phi{}/ increases.  (~41kyr period)
- cos \phi{} cos \epsilon{} \radic{}[1 + tan \phi{} tan \epsilon{} :: This term is harder to interpret
#+END_QUOTE

The precessional /e sin \omega{}/ is always present as a factor up front. When we have a product of sinusoids then the lower frequency one (like here the precession) act as an envelope for the higher frequency one. while the obliquity /\epsilon{}/ is  wrapped in sin/cos terms and in effect regulated by the latitude /phi{}/. 

Conversely:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In the winter hemisphere, obliquity dominates precession in high latitudes close to the polar night,reflecting the patternof the variations of the instantaneous insolation

** Useful Data
Since Berger's tables there have been further improvements in modeling. The state of the art is described here: https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/a/16599/22874

The first two data files that are linked to, =CLIVAR0N.ASC= and =CLIVAR0P.ASC=, are in a very unusual format. The [[http://vo.imcce.fr/insola/earth/online/earth/online/index.php][online calculator]] at the bottom will output a more easy-to-use format. Note that the calculate output values per the Laskar2004 paper. There is a newer Laskar2010, which will go back further in time. Maybe it has it's own calculator... I haven't looked into it. 

I've saved a file with 1M years and a 1000 year step size (the default) - [[./data/proxy.php]]

Note that there seems to be a phase lag between the two. This may be do to a slow response of the climate system - however a clear reason for this elusive. One would think that a change in insolation should lead to an immediate response from that year's monsoon system. 

An alternate solution is that instead of responding to a June 21st solstice insolation, the system is responding to a change in insolation later in the year. The July 21st insolation provides a better fit. However why the insolation response is "tuned" to a later point in the year is also not easily explainable.

See Ruddiman's book at page 148.

** Gondwana

Super continent centered around South Pole
~ 440 Myrs Ago

Migrates North and collided with proto N.America/Europe -> forms Pangaea

Theory: Land near poles grows ice easier than ocean (see Greenland and Antarctica)

But Gandwana only has a short period of glaciation.. weird! Antarctica is also iceless for a while as well

** Pangaea

Moves North and settles symmetrically around the Equator
Relatively hot (known due to ginko and palms)
Interior is arid bc it's huge and isolated from oceans
- confirmed by *evaporite* deposites (esp is the rift valley that broke it apart)
- no moderating oceans nearby so extreme season
- extreme seasons inhibit glacier formation (b/c super hot summers melt ice)
- also *red beds* correlate with super hot weather
- the breakup and connection of two seas creates a radiolarian bloom in the shallow inner sea (Epicontinental Sea) - =175Ma= to =100Ma=
- oceans at 100m higher

** Cretaceous
- Pangaea starts to break up around 175Myrs Ago - finish breaking up around 100 Myrs Ago
- There is no more ice on the poles and the oceans are now ~100m higher
- Much warmer climate for some reason
- Higher CO2 levels account for higher temperatures but not for the more even temperature from pole to equator
- ocean heat transport hypothesis :: that the ocean circulation was much faster. But models don't support this theory. Or at least it's not sufficient
- Maybe the data is skewed b/c of chemical processes on the ocean floor. So temperature proxies (plankton) was been altered

- Since no ice sheets in the cretaceous, all the ice was in water in the oceans. 72m of sea level
- Since the water was warmer it expanded adding another ~7meters of water
- The added water also made the rock sag

- Inland/Continental seas have a higher heat capacity than exposed land/rock - so the climate will be moderated (but you lose coast line.. so what's the real net effect?)

Less temperature swings from high sea levels should lead to easier glaciation!

*** Continent Collision
Is geologically rare

- Leads to a build up of crust as it stacks up into a plateau - leaving more room for oceans so you get lower sea levels
- India crashed into South Asia 100Myrs ago and has made the oceans lower 10m since then (ongoing process)

** Asteroid Goes Boom
Happened 64Myrs ago
- 70% extinction
- Iridium layer across the planet (but it's typically mixed by bioturbescense.. so signal is often lost)
- Pretty soon causes cooling due to blocking out the sun and stuff, but the added CO2 then leads a temporary warming. This may then release *methane clathrates* from the bottom of the ocean which then leads to even more warming (lasts 100,000 years)

- =5Ma=
- Has a water deficit (less rivers than global average) so water is always replenished from Atlantic (the outflow is called the MOW - Mediterranean Outflow Water - and is warm and salty)
- *Messinian Salinity Crisis* evidence of the whole sea drying out several times over
- Salt layers separated by sapropels that then /burn down/ over time as oxygen percolates to those layers - can lead to /ghost sapropels/ when they dissappear entirely

** Last Glacial Maximum
- After the last interglacial period - the Eemian (=115kyrs=). 
- Around =33kyrs= ago. 
- It's a period of huge ice sheets on land (and increased albedo)
- Less forest, more deserts,steppes,grasslands
- Sea level was 115m lower
- Temperature was 5\deg{}C below present

The weird phenomena is that CO_{2} also dropped - even though less carbon was now locked in land based plants. It's theorized that the CO_2 built up near Antarctica's shore in the deep. This is determined b/c there was a sudden excess of C^14 (more than was being produced naturally in the upper atmosphere). This stored CO_{2} would have been C^{14} poor.

** Bond cycles
- Theorized ~7000 cycle that triggers *Heinrich events*
- During glacial periods large groupd of icebergs break off and take out a lot of *ice rafted debris*
- Lead to sudden large changes in \shy{}^{18}O/sea temperature/salinity
- Mostly occuring around the Laurentide icesheet
- The Heinrich evnts Coincides with big changes in temperature in Greenland icecores which are known as *Dansgaard-Oeschger events* - which each last about 500-2000 years
- The warming is rapid (decades) and the cooling back down is slow (centuries)
- At the end of a cool period another Heinrich event occures and the Bond cycles repeates

** Heinrich 1
After *Heinrich 1* we have change in sea surface temperatures 
- North Atlantic + Eastern Tropical Pacific are colder
- Warm western tropical and souther Atlantic.

** Bølling interstadial* 
- Heinrich 1 seems to trigger a long period called the Bolling-Allerod interstadial.
- starts at =14.6kyr= 
- We also have a huge rise in sea level (15m in 500 years). The *Meltwater pulse 1A*
- interrupted by cold events like the *Older Dryas*
- Antarctica enters the *Antarctic Cold Reversal* - a 1kyr plateau in deglaciation/warming which lasts till the Northern Hemisphere's
- The interstadial ends with the *Younger Dryas*.
- The subsequent cold period (15\deg{} colder than present in Greenland) lasts till =11.5kyr= and the second *Meltwater pulse 1B*
