_The Asian monsoon over the past 640,000 years and ice age terminations_ *Hai Cheng et al.* Nature (2016)

.Observations:
* ^18^O varies with insolation at ~60 degrees North
* Exhibits a "stepped" behavior for unknown reasons
* The main driver is hypothesized to be changes in the Monsoon

.Monsoon mechanism (in theory..)
* Monsoon moisture from the Indian ocean rains out heavier molecules over the ocean
* "light" ^18^O poor moisture reaches the continent

_The Asian monsoon over the past 640,000 years and ice age terminations_ *Hai Cheng et al.* Nature (2016)

.Unknowns:
* when ^18^O goes up, what is the actual change in the monsoon strength?
* cave water = monsoon + non-monsoon rains
* what is the isotope signature of each type of rain?
* ...
* what is "monsoon strength"? (length of season? peak rainfall intensity? cumulative rianfall amount?)

== Introduction

[.text-left]
====
Objective:: To generate a location specific climate metric
Motivation:: We often want to correlate phenomena to the presence of a climate system in a locale

._Using IMERG precipitation patterns to index climate at the mesoscale: A basis rotation method based on climate bistability_
*patterns* :: extraction by PCA/EOF/SVD
*mesoscale* :: 10 yrs of IMERG data presents new synergies with PCA
*climate bistability* :: simplifying constraint in many climate systems
*basis rotation* :: a new way to "fix" the PCA
====

== Motivating example

Two monsoon systems in South East Asia

We suspect each system's precipitation has an associated ^18^O concentration

.Visual inspection
* A "Dry Season" at the beginning of the year (controlled by ENSO)
* No particlarly clear correlation between rain amounts and isotope
* No clear "summer" or "winter" seasons

.Questions:
* What is the ^18^O signature of the winter/summer monsoon?
* Does the ^18^O covary with the winter/summer monsoons?
* When is the summer/winter monsoon exactly?

.What we would like is to calculate correlation coefficients
* ^18^O vs. "Summer Monsoonness"
* ^18^O vs. "Winter Monsoonness"

*We need a _local_ climate metric to quantify the presence of a climate phenomena*

.Observations:
. Climate is either "summer monsoon" or "winter monsoon"
. Climate can't be both! (except maybe in a transition month)
. Many climate phenomena will exhibit bistability: ENSO, NAO, AO, SAM

.Fix:
. Divide the PC1/PC2 plane in two to halves
. Such that you minimize the variance of both halves
. The centroid of each half yield the "true" pattern

* Notice how each month's rain looks like:

`MonthlyRain = ClimatePattern + Noise`

* However, since you can't have negative rain, the *"Noise"* is all positive values.

. Find the average power of the *"Noise"*
. Subtract it from all the data
. Rerun the PCA bisection

== Fixing the EOF: Dry Season elimination !!TODO!!
image:diagram/sv-projections-dry.svg[]
The Dry Season functions as a “3rd Pattern" but it's of a known shape (ie. no rain)


== Fixing the EOF: Mixing months !!TODO!!
image:diagram/sv-projections-interseason.svg[]

One month during each year, when we go from a Summer Monsoon to a Winter Monsoon, the two patterns intermix. After our first pass, we can isolate which month this is and reconstruct a more robust basis in a second pass
